You can view my .vimrc file [on GitHub](https://github.com/williambl/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc). It's patched together from various sources.
Here I'm going to do a line-by-line explanation of why I have written what I have.

```
set history=500
```
I have this so that I can undo as far back as I need to.

```
set autoindent
set tabstop=8 softtabstop=0 expandtab shiftwidth=4 smarttab
```
Various indentation/tab improvements including autoindentation and  tabs expanding to 4 spaces.

```
set autoread
```
If the file I'm editing is modified externally, vim reloads it.

```
command W w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
```
:W does the same as :w but with sudo - useful for when you forget to run vim as sudo.

```
set ruler
set number
```
I can't stand editing a file without being able to see line numbers and my location on the page.

```
set hlsearch
```
Highlighting seach results makes searching much better.

```
filetype indent plugin on
```
Needed for various things.

```
syntax enable
```
Enables syntax highlighting.

```
map <C-j> <C-W>j
map <C-k> <C-W>k
map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
```
This is amazing - it allows you to move across windows with ctrl+hjkl rather than ctrl+w hjkl. Saves so much time. It's from [the ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim).

```
set ignorecase
set smartcase
```
Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters.

```
set backspace=indent,eol,start
```
Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'flazz/vim-colorschemes'
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
Plug 'Valloric/youcompleteme', { 'do': './install.py' }
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
call plug#end()
```
This uses the amazing [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install my plugins. Here I'll go through them:

```
Plug 'flazz/vim-colorschemes'
```
This includes many colourschemes. I use molokai.

```
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
```
This amazing plugin lets you easily surround text with quotes, html tags, brackets, etc.

```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
```
This makes commenting really streamlined.

```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```
This adds a very useful tree view to see your files and open new ones without leaving vim.

```
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'
```
Adds git support to nerdtree. A must have if you use git and nerdtree.

```
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
```
While we're talking about git, here's a plugin that allows you to use git from within vim!

```
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
```
This adds loads of language-specific functionality. Much better than installing all the language-specific plugins seperately.

```
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
```
This plugin gives a great status bar at the bottom with loads of info. On my system I had to fiddle a bit with the symbols to get them to work.

```
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
```
Themes for vim-airline.

```
Plug 'Valloric/youcompleteme', { 'do': './install.py' }
```
This plugin adds autocomplete for loads of languages.

```
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
```
This adds a line along the side showing git additions, deletions or changes.

Okay, now we're out of the plugins. There's still some more stuff though.

```
colorscheme molokai
```
Other colour schemes are available.

```
let g:airline_theme='molokai'
```
Other airline themes area available.

```
if !exists('g:airline_symbols')
    let g:airline_symbols = {}
endif
```
Creating an array of airline symbols to fill.

```
let g:airline_symbols.branch = 'âŽ‡'
```
Changing the branch symbol to prevent it from being rendered as just a question mark in a box.

That's my .vimrc. If you have any suggestions or comments, please do send them to me with one of the contact options.

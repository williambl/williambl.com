You can view my .vimrc file [on GitHub](https://github.com/williambl/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc). It's patched together from various sources.
Here I'm going to do a line-by-line explanation of why I have written what I have.

{% highlight vim %}
set history=500
{% endhighlight %}
I have this so that I can undo as far back as I need to.

{% highlight vim %}
set autoindent
set tabstop=8 softtabstop=0 expandtab shiftwidth=4 smarttab
{% endhighlight %}
Various indentation/tab improvements including autoindentation and  tabs expanding to 4 spaces.

{% highlight vim %}
set autoread
{% endhighlight %}
If the file I'm editing is modified externally, vim reloads it.

{% highlight vim %}
command W w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
{% endhighlight %}
:W does the same as :w but with sudo - useful for when you forget to run vim as sudo.

{% highlight vim %}
set ruler
set number
{% endhighlight %}
I can't stand editing a file without being able to see line numbers and my location on the page.

{% highlight vim %}
set hlsearch
{% endhighlight %}
Highlighting seach results makes searching much better.

{% highlight vim %}
filetype indent plugin on
{% endhighlight %}
Needed for various things.

{% highlight vim %}
syntax enable
{% endhighlight %}
Enables syntax highlighting.

{% highlight vim %}
map <C-j> <C-W>j
map <C-k> <C-W>k
map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
{% endhighlight %}
This is amazing - it allows you to move across windows with ctrl+hjkl rather than ctrl+w hjkl. Saves so much time. It's from [the ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim).

{% highlight vim %}
set ignorecase
set smartcase
{% endhighlight %}
Use case insensitive search, except when using capital letters.

{% highlight vim %}
set backspace=indent,eol,start
{% endhighlight %}
Allow backspacing over autoindent, line breaks and start of insert action

{% highlight vim %}
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
Plug 'flazz/vim-colorschemes'
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
Plug 'Valloric/youcompleteme', { 'do': './install.py' }
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
call plug#end()
{% endhighlight %}
This uses the amazing [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install my plugins. Here I'll go through them:

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'flazz/vim-colorschemes'
{% endhighlight %}
This includes many colourschemes. I use molokai.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
{% endhighlight %}
This amazing plugin lets you easily surround text with quotes, html tags, brackets, etc.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdcommenter'
{% endhighlight %}
This makes commenting really streamlined.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
{% endhighlight %}
This adds a very useful tree view to see your files and open new ones without leaving vim.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin'
{% endhighlight %}
Adds git support to nerdtree. A must have if you use git and nerdtree.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
{% endhighlight %}
While we're talking about git, here's a plugin that allows you to use git from within vim!

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
{% endhighlight %}
This adds loads of language-specific functionality. Much better than installing all the language-specific plugins seperately.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline'
{% endhighlight %}
This plugin gives a great status bar at the bottom with loads of info. On my system I had to fiddle a bit with the symbols to get them to work.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'vim-airline/vim-airline-themes'
{% endhighlight %}
Themes for vim-airline.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'Valloric/youcompleteme', { 'do': './install.py' }
{% endhighlight %}
This plugin adds autocomplete for loads of languages.

{% highlight vim %}
Plug 'airblade/vim-gitgutter'
{% endhighlight %}
This adds a line along the side showing git additions, deletions or changes.

Okay, now we're out of the plugins. There's still some more stuff though.

{% highlight vim %}
colorscheme molokai
{% endhighlight %}
Other colour schemes are available.

{% highlight vim %}
let g:airline_theme='molokai'
{% endhighlight %}
Other airline themes area available.

{% highlight vim %}
if !exists('g:airline_symbols')
    let g:airline_symbols = {}
endif
{% endhighlight %}
Creating an array of airline symbols to fill.

{% highlight vim %}
let g:airline_symbols.branch = 'âŽ‡'
{% endhighlight %}
Changing the branch symbol to prevent it from being rendered as just a question mark in a box.

That's my .vimrc. If you have any suggestions or comments, please do send them to me with one of the contact options.
